## Description

### THE MOUNTAIN NEVER ENDS

**Shredsquatch** is a heart-pounding first-person snowboarding game where distance is survival. Inspired by the classic SkiFree, you'll carve down procedurally generated peaks, pulling off sick tricks while something terrifying lurks behind you.

### SHRED OR DIE

- **Infinite Procedural Terrain** - Every run is different. Slopes, forests, cliffs, and abandoned chairlifts stretch on forever.
- **First-Person Intensity** - Feel the rush of carving at 120 km/h with dynamic FOV and immersive sound design.
- **14+ Tricks** - Spins (180-1080), grabs (Nose/Indy/Melon/Stalefish), and flips. Chain combos for massive multipliers up to x3.
- **7 Rail Types** - Grind fallen pines, fences, log piles, metal barriers, cabin ridges, pipes, and chairlift cables.
- **Day/Night Cycle** - Race from dawn to dusk to darkness. Unlock night mode for headlamp-lit terror with aurora borealis.

### THE CHASE

At 5km, **HE** awakens. The Sasquatch emerges from the fog with glowing red eyes. He's faster when you slow down. He catches up when you crash. The only escape is forward.

- Rubber-band AI keeps the tension high
- Proximity alerts warn you when he's close
- Crash and he'll close the gap
- His eyes glow brighter as he gets closer

### STUNNING VISUALS

9 custom URP shaders bring the mountain to life:

- Snow sparkle that glitters with the sun angle
