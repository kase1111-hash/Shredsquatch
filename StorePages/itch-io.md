## Description

### 🏔️ THE MOUNTAIN NEVER ENDS

**Shredsquatch** is a heart-pounding first-person snowboarding game where distance is survival. Inspired by the classic SkiFree, you'll carve down procedurally generated peaks, pulling off sick tricks while something terrifying lurks behind you.

### 🏂 SHRED OR DIE

- **Infinite Procedural Terrain** - Every run is different. Slopes, forests, cliffs, and abandoned chairlifts stretch on forever.
- **First-Person Intensity** - Feel the rush of carving at 120 km/h with dynamic FOV and immersive sound design.
- **14+ Tricks** - Spins, grabs, flips, and grinds. Chain combos for massive multipliers.
- **Day/Night Cycle** - Race from dawn to dusk to darkness. Unlock night mode for headlamp-lit terror.

### 👹 THE CHASE

At 5km, **HE** awakens. The Sasquatch emerges from the fog with glowing red eyes. He's faster when you slow down. He catches up when you crash. The only escape is forward.

- Rubber-band AI keeps the tension high
- Proximity alerts warn you when he's close
- Crash and he'll close the gap
