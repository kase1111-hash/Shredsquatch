## About This Game

### THE MOUNTAIN CALLS. SO DOES SOMETHING ELSE.

**Shredsquatch** reimagines the classic endless runner as a tense, trick-filled first-person snowboarding experience. Inspired by SkiFree's iconic monster chase, you'll push your skills—and your luck—on infinite procedural peaks.

Every run starts the same: dawn breaks over fresh powder, the slope stretches endlessly ahead, and your board is itching to carve. But at 5 kilometers, everything changes. A bone-chilling roar echoes across the mountain. The fog parts. Two red eyes pierce the mist behind you.

**The Sasquatch has awakened. And he doesn't stop.**

### 🏂 ARCADE SNOWBOARDING REIMAGINED

Feel the rush of first-person shredding with responsive, arcade-style physics:

- **Carve & Tuck** - Lean into turns for speed boosts. Tuck for max velocity.
- **14+ Tricks** - 180s to 1080s, nose grabs to stalefish, frontflips and backflips.
- **Combo System** - Chain tricks within 1 second for multipliers up to x3.
- **Rail Grinding** - Hit fallen pines, fences, pipes, and chairlift cables.

---

### 🏔️ INFINITE PROCEDURAL TERRAIN

No two runs are the same. Our terrain generator creates:

- Gentle tutorial slopes (0-2km)
- Dense forests and jump zones (2-5km)
- Extreme terrain, cliffs, and abandoned infrastructure (5km+)
- Day-to-night progression with visibility changes
- Daily seeds for leaderboard competition

---

### 👹 THE CHASE THAT NEVER ENDS

The Sasquatch uses rubber-band AI to maintain relentless pressure:

- **You're fast?** He speeds up with burst chases.
- **You crash?** He closes the gap rapidly.
- **You're perfect?** He falls back... but never leaves.

The proximity bar tells you how close death is. Green means safe. Red means run. Pulsing red means pray.
